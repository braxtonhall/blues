# blues
A companion to the Discord Rhythm bot

## ideas:
- take the queue from a specified time period or day to generate Youtube / Spotify playlists
-  Youtube playlist first, add Spotify toggle (would need search)
-  Turn Rythm announcements on and pull from there?
-  connect sqlite db to track every song that was queued
